This sample uses the Message Broker for AWS IoT to send and receive messages
through an MQTT connection. On startup, the device connects to the server,
subscribes to a topic, and begins publishing messages to that topic.
The device should receive those same messages back from the message broker,
since it is subscribed to that same topic.
